# should-counter-api

> What _should_ technology do? Computers don't understand what _should_ be,
> only what _is_. Behind use of the word "should" lives the messy soup of human
> beliefs on how the world ought to function: emotions, perspective, culture,
> politics, and :turtle: :turtle: :turtle: all the way down.

`should-counter-api` offers a REST API to track "should" usage across your
software development team.

This puppy is intended to be used by a chat bot &mdash; maybe
[shoulda-coulda](http://github.com/mdb/shoulda-coulda)? &mdash; or some other
communications-monitoring program.
